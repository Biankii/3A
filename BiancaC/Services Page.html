<td bgcolor="pink">Our management consulting services focus on our clients' most critical issues and opportunities: strategy, marketing, organization, operations, 
technology, transformation, digital, advanced analytics, 
corporate finance, mergers & acquisitions and sustainability across all industries and geographies. We bring deep, functional expertise, 
but are known for our holistic perspective: we capture 
value across boundaries and between the silos of any organization. We have proven a multiplier effect from optimizing the sum of the parts, not just 
the individual pieces.</td>

<td bgcolor="grey">Customer service training is the coaching that employees receive with the goal of improving support and satisfaction among customers. A strong customer service training program includes exercises for improving interpersonal communication, product knowledge, conflict resolution, crisis management, and more.</td>
<td bgcolor="orange">Data enhancement generally refers to the process of improving your, or your client's, first-party data with context pulled from additional, external sources. This process is also referred to as data append, which generally describes adding external data to your records to expand them.</td>
